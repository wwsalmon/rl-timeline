# Rocket League Visual History Project
By Samson Zhang, wwsalmon on GitHub

A lot goes on within an Esport. New teams are constantly formed, players break away from their orgs and sign with new orgs, hundreds of high-level competitions go down in a year. It's hard to keep up with what's happening, and even harder to have a clear idea of what happened in the past. Wikis like Liquipedia are very useful for finding specific information, but it's hard to get an idea of the complex, interweaving storylines of players and teams over time from tables and static pages.

My aim with this project is to conceptualize a way to visually show the historical and current events happening throughout an Esport. By using interactive timelines, I hope to portray the movements and performances of teams and players over time in a way that is more easily understandable and contextually aware than the walls of text on wikis.

I made a demonstration of a page of Kronovi's player history using HTML, CSS, and JS. It's far from a perfect implementation, and is very limited in terms of expandability and interaction, but serves as a proof of concept of what I hope to one day be possible.
