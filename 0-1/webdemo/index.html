			<h1 id='introduction'>Vision</h1>
			<p>The best part of Esports is the storylines. In Rocket League: Kronovi the Mountain, the very first world champion; Paschy90, the team-building legend, always just a hair away from lifting the trophy; Turbopolsa, leading his team to break through the champion's curse and become the three-time. These are the legends of the scene, and it's players like them that get people excited to watch the highest tier of Rocket League competition.</p>

			<p>But Esports is hectic. It seems like every day a team disbands, or a player leaves, or suddenly is acquired by a new org and has a totally different name and branding. Major matches and upsets happen all the time and are then talked about for weeks; it's hard to piece everything together unless you've just been there from the very beginning. Resources like Liquipedia and r/RocketLeagueEsports have done a great deal to provide a place to get the latest and most comprehensive information. However, there's still a great deal of piecing-together to be done.</p>

			<p>RL Timeline aims to tell the history of Rocket League Esports in a whole new way, with the same level of storytelling of dedicated spotlight videos and articles, but the same level of rigor and thoroughness of a wiki page. RL Timeline lays out all the relevant events - team transfers, competition results - in chronological order relative to each other on a timeline, complete with the first-hand context of Tweets and from-then reactions and commentary.</p>
